# Boxplot Analysis with R
This repository contains R code for performing boxplot analysis on the classic Iris dataset. The code utilizes the ggplot2 and plyr packages for visualization and analysis.

# Overview
Boxplots are a fundamental visualization technique for summarizing the distribution of a dataset. This analysis script demonstrates how to create boxplots and add standard error bars, as well as display individual data points along with the boxplots.

# Usage
To use the code in this repository:

1. **Install R Packages:** If you haven't already, install the required R packages by running the following command in R:
   
      install.packages(c("ggplot2", "plyr"))

2. **Load R Libraries:** Load the necessary libraries in R:

      library(ggplot2)

      library(plyr)

4. **Load Iris Dataset:** The analysis is performed on the classic Iris dataset. The dataset is loaded automatically in the script.

5. **Run Analysis Script:** Execute the R script boxplot.R to generate boxplots with standard error bars and individual data points.

# Dataset
The Iris dataset (iris) is a built-in dataset in R and contains measurements of various iris flowers. The dataset is widely used for introductory data analysis and visualization tasks.
